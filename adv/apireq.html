<!-- If u wnat to understand what is happening in the code u can have a look of it -->

<!-- 1. Defining the API URL
javascript
Copy code
const requestUrl = 'https://api.github.com/users/hiteshchoudhary'
This is the URL where your script will request data from. It’s pointing to the GitHub API to fetch information about the user hiteshchoudhary.
2. Creating an XMLHttpRequest object
javascript
Copy code
const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
XMLHttpRequest is a built-in object in JavaScript that allows us to fetch data from a server without reloading the page.
3. Opening a connection
javascript
Copy code
xhr.open('GET', requestUrl);
xhr.open() prepares a request:
'GET' means we’re asking the server to get data.
requestUrl is the URL where the data is located.
This step initializes the request but doesn’t send it yet.
4. Defining what happens during the request
javascript
Copy code
xhr.onereadystatechange = function() {
    console.log(xhr.readyState);
    if (xhr.readyState === 4) {
        const data = JSON.parse(this.responseText);
        console.log(typeof data);
        console.log(data.followers);
    }
}
Here’s what’s happening:

xhr.onereadystatechange: This function runs whenever the state of the request changes (from UNSENT to DONE).

The readyState can have values from 0 to 4:
0 = UNSENT: Request is created but not opened.
1 = OPENED: Request is opened but not sent.
2 = HEADERS_RECEIVED: Headers are received.
3 = LOADING: Data is being downloaded.
4 = DONE: The operation is complete, and the response is ready.
console.log(xhr.readyState):

This logs the current readyState to the console so you can see how the request progresses.
if (xhr.readyState === 4):

This checks if the request is fully complete (state 4).
Once it’s complete, it processes the response:
this.responseText contains the data returned by the server (in JSON format).
JSON.parse(this.responseText) converts the JSON string into a JavaScript object.
data.followers accesses the number of followers of the user from the data received.
5. Sending the request
javascript
Copy code
xhr.send();
Finally, this actually sends the request to the server. -->
